## 3. What needs to be done, and in what order, to reach my goals?

1. Understand frontend development
    1. Follow the roadmap at [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/frontend)
    2. Define scope of learning for each topic learnt.

    4. Practice tech learnt by publishing the knowledge learnt.
    5. Take notes and diagrams for reference.
    6. Understand the pros and cons of the tech being learnt. 
2. Manage frontend devs and roadmap
    1. Collaborate to define frontend best practices we will adapt as a team.
    2. Perform code review and technical discussions with frontend devs.
    3. Understand where frontend devs need help and provide them the support required.
    4. Support in defining the product roadmap

    2. Check how this experience can be leveraged in the sap domain such as SAP BTP and SAP Cloud development. 

## 4. Conclusion:
The above is a rough plan to go through the journey of understanding frontend development. 

*Note:* The above plan was started in Trello (by Attlassian) and was moved to GitHub to practice markdown and get acquainted with GitHub features.
